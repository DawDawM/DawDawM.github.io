<h2>Induction Project</h2>
<p>In this project we were asked to create something to do with helping the enviornment. I created a sort of calculator that measured how much enegry you saved by recycling different materials. The calculator would give you that amount you saved in kilowatts however, I decided to give an example of how much that would save because I thought that way, it would be easier for the user to visualize how much that really is. When I was writing the program and learnt a lot about how computers work through code and how I have to think like them in a similar way. This has been beneficial as I have been getting less errors with my code. For example, when I was making the calculator I could't figure out why the examples are being shown randomly, but then I realised that I had to write the IF statements backwords for the condition to be met properly. </p>
