<h1>Induction Project in Detail </h1>
<p>When writing making the induction project we were firs asked to create an outline and describe the main idea and purpose of the project. For this I created a simple word file and included a semi detailed description of what the program is. In the outline I also described the process that the program is going to go through so that it works.</p>
<p>In the same word file I also included the pseudo code for the project and it presented what sort of methods I was going to use to make the program work. </p>
<p>The third task we were asked to do is to create a test table. The purpose of a test table is, as the name suggests, test the program. I tested whether all the variables worked correctly and whether the user could enter in values within boundries. In total there was 10 variables within my program and 7 of them were floats. This testing proved to be quite usefull as it allowed me to make sure that the program works as expected </p>
<p>Our next task was the most task consuming and the hardest; we had to actually write the program whcih took us about a week. This was the first time we have used python in a few months so we had to take some time trying to remember how to write code. My program was very easy to write however at the time it proved to be qutie a challenge as I had to always remember computational thinking and consider how I would write diffrent loops and functions. I was able to finish the whole program in about a week, this includes making it user friendly and making sure that I wasn't able to break it </p>
<p>Our last activity was writing an evaluation to see whether the code met our expectations and to make sure that it does what it was supposed to do in the first place. We looked at how our code differed from our pseudo code and we were able to see how our ideas changed over the course of the week. </p>
