<h1> Apps For Good in detail </h1>
<p> My teammate and I came up with the idea for the app because when someone misses the bus, it's often not their fault and it is incredibly frustrating when we miss the bus by more or less 30 seconds. Now, that 30 seconds could be enough to ruin somone's day or even life. For example, if someone was headed for a job interview and a minor inconvinience has caused them to miss the bus and thus they don't get the job.
The way the app work is simple.
